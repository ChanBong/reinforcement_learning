## Introduction

### Learning Goals

- Understand the Reinforcement Learning problem and how it differs from Supervised Learning
- Understand the concept of Sequential Deseicion Making


### Summary

- Reinforcement Learning (RL) tackles the problem of making optimal decisions to maximize expected cummulative reward
- In RL an agent learns from experiences it gains by interacting with the environment. In Supervised Learning we cannot affect the environment. In RL we have sequential non i.i.d data
- In RL rewards are often delayed in time and the agent tries to maximize a long-term goal. For example, one may need to make seemingly suboptimal moves to reach a winning position in a game.
- An agent interacts with the environment via states, actions and rewards.
- Both agent and environment have their constantly changing states
- Major components of an RL system are policy, value function and model
